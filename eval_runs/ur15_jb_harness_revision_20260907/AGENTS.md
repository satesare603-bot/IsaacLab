# UR15 production-line video work

Apply the repository AGENTS.md and THREAD Vault protocol.

## User-selected video format (2026-09-11)

- For all new revisions, render only the process view (`--views process`).
- Generate only `*_split_process_*_review.mp4`, with the process descriptions burned in.
- Use `scripts/encode_process_review_video.py` to encode the PNG frames directly into that MP4. Do not generate an intermediate raw MP4 or a separate wide-view movie.
- Put only this video type in new Downloads deliveries and ZIP archives. Native models, source, still images and verification records can accompany it.
- `data/video_delivery_policy.json` records the same user preference. Older encoders, orchestration scripts and four-video packages are historical reproduction inputs, not defaults for new work.

The user confirmed `UR15_JB_OP030_split_process_v06_review.mp4` and instructed proceeding to OP040 on 2026-09-11. Use the delivered v06 native and its recorded product state as the starting point. User review of the video is not a formal physical-validity verdict.

OP040's final-frame incoming snapshot is in `audit/op040_incoming_product_v01.json`. `OP040_工程・部品確認書_v01.md` proposes six new wires, an incoming distribution subassembly, and separate routing/fastening stations. These are review proposals, not accepted product requirements; do not treat the proposed D04 or extra station as present in v06.

On 2026-09-12 the user selected actual-product connection drawings and parts
lists, and requested searching the internet because no such files were available.
`analysis/op040_real_reference_research_20260912.md` records the public evidence
and its missing details. The Ampere product is a reference candidate, not an
adopted replacement for the v06 product. Keep unpublished dimensions and part
numbers unknown until their basis and the scope of the product change are set.

## User decisions received on 2026-09-13

- The user subsequently approved matching the Ampere public circuit and major
  components, including a new upstream product revision. Preserve v06. The
  September 12 candidate status above is historical; unpublished manufacturing
  dimensions and complete part numbers are still unknown.
- Divide work among three stations operating on separate workpieces in parallel.
  This does not require three arms at each station.
- Video/model motion production was paused. The currently authorized work is
  selecting hands and documenting their process roles before arm trajectories.
- Prefer a single arm where it completes the task. Retain OP030-A/B as the user's
  dual-arm candidates. Consider three arms only where their distinct roles are
  necessary; permission to consider them is not a selected three-arm mechanism.
- Consider two-, three-, and four-finger hands. Set the finger count, arrangement,
  drive configuration, fingertip geometry and grasp interfaces before designing
  complete arm motion. The supplied G3/G4 documents are design inputs, not
  verified product capabilities or automatically adopted acceptance criteria.
- The v06 B wire animation prescribes the full centerline and derives hand
  targets from it. Its length and geometry checks do not demonstrate physical
  S-bending using endpoint grasps. Do not present them as such.
- See `analysis/hand_selection_inputs_20260913.md` for source comparison,
  candidate roles and unresolved hand-selection inputs. Do not reinstate deleted
  cable hold-down mechanisms as an automatic response to the S-bend question.

## Subsequent handoff decision on 2026-09-13

- The user withdrew the pallet upper-retainer proposal and requested fastening
  while the fingers continue holding the cable/terminal. The v01 retainer pack
  is historical comparison evidence, not a hardware selection.
- Compare continuous hand retention and fastening at the same work position.
  Do not describe release at B followed by transport and regrasp at C as solving
  the unsupported interval. Do not invent a transport-capable temporary torque.
- Two holding arms plus station-mounted fastening units are a comparison
  candidate; no extra robot or selected fastening hardware is authorized by
  that candidate label. Keep the existing simultaneous different-size fastening
  requirement visible. Three-station task redistribution remains unresolved.
- `data/hand_held_fastening_v01.json` and the corresponding analysis document
  record the new direction. Existing hand-function v01 and fixture v01 describe
  the earlier handoff proposals. Arm trajectory and video production stay paused.
- The subsequent user `ok` authorized the next comparison step.
  `analysis/three_station_connection_groups_v01.md` proposes A for mechanical
  mounting, B for main/precharge/discharge power connections, and C for auxiliary
  and control connections. This is not a selected factory process or arm count.
  Actual common fastener stacks and incoming one-piece harnesses may change the
  B/C boundary; electrical common nodes do not establish physical shared bolts.
- `data/hand_target_contacts_v02.json` updates target-family station labels and
  holding periods for that proposal. Use F01-F10 for the current correspondence;
  the v01 A/B-prefixed IDs and placement-at-B/fastening-at-C notes are historical.
  Busbars and fuse bodies are assigned to their connection stage as candidates;
  separately supplied support bodies may be mounted at A. Two fingers remain
  the baseline comparison. Contact dimensions, force and installed hand counts
  are unselected, including the three targets without photo-location annotations.
- `analysis/hand_tool_access_v01.md` observes the unchanged isolated EDGE/GUIDE
  meshes. The 50 mm illustrative tool band has a different result from the
  extended band: in the near pose, the tool axis intersects a gripper-body
  surface at 120.577 mm above the sample connection plane. Do not extrapolate
  the short-band radial difference to a complete socket or fastening unit.
  The observation does not select tool dimensions, redesign the hand, or
  establish physical validity. Preserve the source mesh and saved poses when
  reproducing it; production arm motion and video remain paused.
- The user then requested moving the black hardware away from the terminal to
  maximize tool space. `analysis/hand_body_setback_v01.md` compares 30/60 mm
  rearward body offsets against the original EDGE sample. The original hardware
  geometry and four joint states are retained; the blue carriers extend while
  the terminal-side contact contours retain their world positions. Offsets,
  beam sections and tool cylinders are comparison values, not selected hardware.
  Upper tool space and lower fingertip space are separate observations. Existing
  carrier/mount surface overlaps remain recorded; mounting details, stiffness
  and force capability are unresolved. No upper retainer or arm motion is added.
