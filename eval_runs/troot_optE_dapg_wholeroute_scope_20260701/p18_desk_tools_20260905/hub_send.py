"""Hub-only send / verify / resend tool for the pane w2:p18 (T-ROOT-OPS-SUPERVISOR).

Design of record: eval_runs/troot_optE_dapg_wholeroute_scope_20260701/P18_D1_VERIFY_CYCLE2_20260905.md Part 2
(PROPOSE v3, increment 1'). Authorized by Rs1 (the human): files = transcript line 39366; build = line 40230.
Post-build fixes (2026-09-06, 層2/層5 cycle 1): CONTROLS_20260906.md in this directory lists them with the rows.

Procedure (send):
- Guard = a pane bind, not a two-factor bind: HERDR_PANE_ID must be w2:p18 and CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID must equal
  the live w2:p18 agent session. Subagents and background jobs of the hub inherit both (measured 2026-09-05) and
  cannot be excluded by the environment: they run this tool only as HUB_SEND_READONLY=1 ... --dry_run (nothing
  is sent, pressed or written in that mode). Every row records hub_session_id and child_session.
- Roster = non-comment lines of scripts/validations/nest_role_labels.txt read at run time, minus RETIRED.
  Resolution = `herdr pane list`, w2 panes that carry an agent kind and a live agent session, label "w2:pN ROLE"
  (a pane attribute under herdr 0.9.0; `agent list` carries no name) -> exact match -> exactly one live agent.
  An agent whose `agent` kind is not claude is refused (refused(agent_type_not_banked)): no delivery table is
  banked for other kinds (the node's codex exclusion), so the tool does not send to them (fail-closed; stricter
  than the spec's UNKNOWN(table-not-banked)).
  --to_pane skips role resolution for the primary member: the pane must be a live w2 agent with a live label in
  the roster (--control lifts the roster check); the head carries that label (row fields resolved_by = "pane",
  to_requested = the typed --to); a --to that itself resolves uniquely to another pane is refused
  (refused(contradiction)); retired labels, unlabelled panes and the hub's own pane are refused.
  HUB_SEND_REPO (env) redirects the repo root (roster file and init's git leg) for simulations from a copied
  directory; unset in normal use.
- Order: resolve every member -> read every member -> decide every member -> only then allocate the id, compose the
  text once (head line + body + footer), write bodies/m-p18-N.txt, send the identical bytes to each member.
  --id completes a held fan-out: the bytes are read back from bodies/m-p18-N.txt (never re-composed), the members
  must belong to the recorded fan-out, and a --body_file whose body differs from the stored body is refused.
  Only members never handed to `herdr pane send-text` (a pre-send held row, or HELD(fanout_stopped)) are sent; every
  other member is skipped with skipped(<state>) before any read, so one id never reaches a queue twice.
- Pre-send decision (fail-closed): HELD when agent_status is not idle/done/working; when a herdr dialog marker is
  anywhere in the viewport (over-HELD by design, never under-HELD); when there is no composer line (prompt glyph +
  U+00A0) or more than one; when the composer shows a folded paste; when the composer holds any non-dim text
  (a draft, or one of our own non-final messages); when the destination is working and --queue was not given.
  Dim text (SGR 2 = a UI suggestion) and the queue hint "Press up to edit queued messages" are not drafts.
  A folded paste hides its identity: our own un-pressed text in a composer reads as HELD(paste_in_composer), not
  as composer_holds_own_message (that state needs an unfolded head line); correlate through the pane's held rows.
  Nothing is ever sent before the whole fan-out has been decided.
- Post-send gate: after `herdr pane send-text` the composer is re-read (up to 6 x 0.25 s). The keypress is pressed only
  when the composer line starts with the head line, or is exactly one folded-paste marker "[Pasted text #N +K lines]"
  whose K+1 equals the line count of the sent text (Claude Code folds a multi-line paste; measured 2026-09-06 on
  m-p18-323, n=1; the marker text is stored in the row as landed_as). A foreign paste of the same line count
  arriving between the pre-send read and the post-send read is the documented residual; a fold whose count
  differs from ours holds as HELD(paste_count_mismatch). Before the keypress the agent status is re-read (one
  `pane list`, <10 ms on herdr 0.9.0; the blind window is the status-detection lag of herdr plus the send-keys
  launch, ~0.45-0.5 s measured 2026-09-13); a working<->idle flip, or a status outside idle/done/working, holds
  (HELD(status_changed)) instead of pressing. Return codes of `pane send-text` and
  `send-keys` are stored (send_rc, keypress_rc); a refused keypress holds (HELD(keypress_refused)) with via none.
  A post-send HELD stops the fan-out: members not yet sent get HELD(fanout_stopped) rows. Any exception after the
  text was placed still appends the row it has built (HELD(error:...) before the keypress, UNKNOWN(error:...)
  after) before propagating.
- Observation: the state of a row comes from the destination transcript, never from the keypress.
  P1 DELIVERED = a user record (string content, promptSource typed|queued, no toolUseResult, not a compaction
  summary, not a local-command echo) containing the sent bytes (evidence user@<byte offset>+<k>, k = character
  index into the decoded content); position > 0 = DELIVERED(fused) when the prefix
  holds other hub heads, DELIVERED(fused_with_unknown_prefix) otherwise (the prefix's first 200 chars are printed,
  never stored). DELIVERED at position 0 may still share its record with later hub messages: fused_with says so.
  Q1 QUEUED(observed) = an enqueue record with the sent bytes, or the queued marker in the viewport.
  Q2 ABSORBED(unacked) = a remove/popAll record followed by a queued_command attachment with the sent bytes
  (the reason field is absent in ~98% of removes: 2600 of 2634 counted 2026-09-05, 2561 of 2603 on 2026-09-06
  over the 28 project transcripts; it is an annotation, not the key). The row keeps absorbed_at = the remove
  record's timestamp (the attachment carries the enqueue time). Non-terminal. A1 DELIVERED(absorbed,acked) =
  after Q2, an assistant record (text or thinking) naming the bare id. Q3 DELIVERED(turn_end) = the P1 shape
  with promptSource queued. Q4 REMOVED = a remove with no following
  attachment or user record. Unknown queue operations on our bytes surface as UNKNOWN(unmapped_op).
  The tool never writes LOST. A DELIVERED verify row after a send row with via "none" means the keypress came
  from outside the tool (the documented operator recovery: read the composer, press Enter once, verify --id);
  origin.kind of the record is "human" even when the tool pressed the key, so it never discriminates. verify
  keeps a HELD state unless it observes something (never HELD -> UNKNOWN(no-record)), skips never-sent
  HELD(fanout_stopped) rows, and computes overdue only for rows with a keypress.
  P1's string-content / no-toolUseResult rule comes from the two false by-hand verdicts of 2026-09-05
  (m-p18-290@w2:p0, m-p18-291@w2:pZ; by_hand_20260905/verify_*.txt), which were tool_result records.
- Measured semantics (2026-09-05, one leg of each n=2 pair has no banked keypress stamp): record 18-23 ms after
  Enter (n=2; the tool's own m-p18-324 on 2026-09-06 = 40 ms, n=3); Enter->working 0.29/0.41 s (n=2);
  Tab->enqueue 4.6-314 s (n=10, 1/10 within 6 s); enqueue->remove 5.9-72.1 s (n=9; the queued_command attachment
  carries the enqueue time); Tab->terminal record (remove for absorbed, user record otherwise) 30.7-517.5 s
  (n=15, median 103 s); viewport 66-80 lines; composer line = U+276F U+00A0, echoes = U+276F U+0020.
- Rows: body_sha256 of a tool row = sha256 of the sent bytes (the file holds them plus one final newline); the
  imported by-hand rows in by_hand_20260905/sent.jsonl keep their sha over the file. DELIVERED rows carry the byte
  offset and the transcript line of the record.
- verify re-reads every non-final row from its stored byte offset (a mid-line offset is resynchronised to the
  next newline); rows without a body file are refused, never scanned. --dry_run (after the subcommand) and
  HUB_SEND_READONLY=1 read and print, write nothing, send nothing.
- resend --id re-sends the same body bytes with an appended "resend of <id> <date>" line as a new row of
  row_type resend (field resend_of); rows of the hub's own control sends are not resent.
- init computes bodies/.floor once by a closed query over the delivered heads of every project transcript, the
  head-shaped tokens of the repo (tracked and untracked, any position) and the id-shaped files of the retired
  by-hand directories (ids_retired_*, desk_msgs_retired_*) of the hub's own session scratchpad — the hub's
  subagents write into that scratchpad, so fixtures elsewhere in it are not counted; it refuses to write while
  .floor exists (a dry run still prints the query's result beside the live floor) or while the by-hand
  directories (ids, desk_msgs) exist un-renamed.
- Operating rule: the row, body file and .floor of a send are committed (pathspec) in the same turn as the send;
  a message body cites only artifacts that exist at send time, with full shas or none.
- Provenance: append_row's flock + loop-write + fsync core is copied from the untracked
  scripts/verification_log_append.py:235-261 (sha256 30509c34b026f18a1a9eb3db44e786f989144d5f9042797b82d680cc75628f4c,
  2026-09-06); the 層4 guard scripts/check_thread_vault_prior_art.sh is untracked too
  (sha256 b8d85cdb99ab66737ee130e5d9624e4eee06ebef98b144ed97a2bcc3e40a5e48, 2026-09-06).
Deviations from v3 section 3-D and from the node DoD are listed in the design of record (section 7) and in
CONTROLS_20260906.md (size, the unmeasured draft half of control (h), the agent-type leg of T/C).
